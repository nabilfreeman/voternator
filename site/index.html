			<h1>Probe makes historic comment landing</h1>

			<p>European robot probe Philae has made the first, historic landing on a comet, after descending from its mothership.</p>

			<p>The lander touched down on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at about 1605 GMT.</p>

			<p>There were cheers and hugs at the control room in Darmstadt, Germany, after the signal was confirmed.</p>

			<p>It was designed to shine a light on some of the mysteries of these icy relics from the formation of the Solar System.</p>

			<p>The landing caps a 6.4 billion-kilometre journey that was begun a decade ago.</p>

			<p>"This is a big step for human civilisation," said Jean-Jacques Dordain, the director-general of the European Space Agency (Esa).</p>

			<p>Shortly after the touchdown was confirmed, Stephan Ulamec, the mission's lander chief, said: "Philae is talking to us... we are on the comet."</p>

			<p>The robot deployed harpoons to fasten itself to the 2.5-mile-wide ball of ice and dust.</p>

			<p>Scientists will use Philae to take pictures of the comet's landscape and to analyse its chemical composition.</p>

			<p>They are hoping the its surface materials will hold fresh insights into the origins of our Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
